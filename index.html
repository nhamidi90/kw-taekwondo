                <h1 class="headings">About Us</h1>

                <p>Koryo Warriors Taekwondo is a club which aims to bring out the best in you! The instructor is very
                    enthusiastic
                    about taekwondo and will push you to reach your goals. We will teach you a series of patterns as
                    well as
                    techniques
                    for self-defence and sparring. During our classes you will make new friends and work along them. You
                    will learn
                    from your seniors and also be given the chance to instruct your juniors as we believe that learning
                    from
                    each
                    other brings out many benefits.</p>

                <h2>So why study taekwondo?</h2>

                <h3>Increase confidence and self-esteem:</h3>

                <p>Throughout your taekwondo journey, you will learn a variety of patterns and techniques. Naturally,
                    mastering a technique
                    will give you a confidence boost as you are feeling good that you accomplished something. Also
                    knowing
                    how to defend
                    yourself in a tough situation can also increase your self-esteem.</p>

                <h3>Physical health: </h3>

                <p>We will often be doing training to increase endurance such as circuits and sparring during our
                    sessions
                    so while it's
                    not the same as other cardio-centric sports, it will be sure to get your blood pumping and increase
                    cardiovascular health. </p>

                <h3>Mental Health:</h3>

                <p>Not only will taekwondo help your cardiovascular health but it will also bring benefits to your
                    mental
                    health. Exercise
                    releases serotonin, which bring feelings of happiness and joy. Training can also give you an outlet
                    to
                    release your
                    stress through all the kicking and punching! </p>

                <h3>Social activity: </h3>

                <p>Learning taekwondo is a great way to get out of the house and meet new people. As you are constantly
                    working alongside
                    your peers, you will naturally become closer together as you go through your taekwondo journey
                    together.
                </p>

                <h3>Focus and self-discipline: </h3>

                <p>learning a new pattern or move can require a great deal of focus. There is a lot of repetition when
                    trying to master
                    everything. This takes time so students have to have the self-discipline if they want to perfect a
                    certain move.</p>

                <p>Does this sound interesting? We hold different classes for children, women or mixed classes. We train
                    people of all
                    ages and level of skill so there is always a class to suit you!</p>

                <p class="first-class">Your first class is free!</p>
