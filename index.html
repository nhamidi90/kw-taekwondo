            <p>Koryo Warriors Taekwondo is a club which aims to bring out the best in you! The instructor is very enthusiastic 
            about taekwondo and will push you to reach your goals. We will teach you a series of patterns as well as techniques 
            for self-defence and sparring. During our classes you will make new friends and work along them. You will learn 
            from your seniors and also be given the chance to instruct your juniors as we believe that learning from each 
            other brings out many benefits.</p>
            
            <h2>So why study taekwondo?</h2>    
            
            <h3>Increase confidence and self-esteem:</h3> 
            
            <p>Throughout your taekwondo journey, you will learn a variety of patterns and techniques. Naturally, mastering a technique 
            will give you a confidence boost as you are feeling good that you accomplished something. Also knowing how to defend 
            yourself in a tough situation can also increase your self-esteem.</p>

            <h3>Physical health: </h3>
            
            <p>We will often be doing training to increase endurance such as circuits and sparring during our sessions so while it's 
            not the same as other cardio-centric sports, it will be sure to get your blood pumping and increase cardiovascular health. </p>

            <h3>Mental Health:</h3>
            
            <p>Not only will taekwondo help your cardiovascular health but it will also bring benefits to your mental health. Exercise
            releases serotonin, which bring feelings of happiness and joy. Training can also give you an outlet to release your 
            stress through all the kicking and punching! </p>

            <h3>Social activity: </h3>
            
            <p>Learning taekwondo is a great way to get out of the house and meet new people. As you are constantly working alongside 
            your peers, you will naturally become closer together as you go through your taekwondo journey together. </p>

            <h3>Focus and self-discipline: </h3>

            <p>learning a new pattern or move can require a great deal of focus. There is a lot of repetition when trying to master
            everything. This takes time so students have to have the self-discipline if they want to perfect a certain move.</p>

            <p>Does this sound interesting? We hold different classes for children, women or mixed classes. We train people of all 
            ages and level of skill so there is always a class to suit you!</p>
