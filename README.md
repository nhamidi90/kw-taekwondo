## Future improvements
* The news page will grow in size as more items are added so pagination could be introduced
* There is potential for  the site to grow by adding more for current students such as a learning section which can include videos on patterns, theory etc.
* Add fully functional contact form
* As more pictures are added to the gallery it would be good to group those from the same event together
