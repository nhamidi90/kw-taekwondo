### Tools

* [Color space](https://mycolor.space/) was used to pick a colour scheme

### Code

* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) were both used to look up and remind myself of various HTML and CSS syntax
* The page title shadow effect was done using code from [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/blog/css-text-outline/) 
<!--
text-shadow:
    3px 3px 2px #000,
    -3px 3px 2px #000,
    -3px -3px 0 #000,
    3px -3px 0 #000;
-->

* [Go make things](https://gomakethings.com/how-to-create-a-sticky-navigation-with-only-css/) Helped me make the navbar sticky using only CSS

<!--
position: sticky;
position: -webkit-sticky;
top: 0;
    
 -->

* The hover effects on classes.html were done using [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/#effects)
